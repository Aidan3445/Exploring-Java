# Exploring-Java
My first java projects.

I'm working through going back and commenting my old code, something I really wish I had done from the start!

Many of these project were based on Coding Train javascript videos and translating to java on my own. 

I use a library from my Northeastern University Fundies 2 class for drawing, the jar file can be found in the jar folder.

This also has my first version of Hardle, which can now be played at http://tinyurl.com/hardlegame on a pc. 
*** Some Hardle features do not work on all mobile devices ***
